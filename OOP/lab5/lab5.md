## Inheritance

##### Task1

Create 10 classes with their names as first 10 aphabetical letters (A, B, C, D, ... , J).

Each next class inherits from previous letter class (ex: `B inherits from A, C inherits from B ...`).

Each class should have their own String property with corresponding letter as their refference (ex: `A - String a; B - String b; ... J - String j;`).

Create by an object of each class type and print it in console in a clever way (such that to be clear each objects states).
