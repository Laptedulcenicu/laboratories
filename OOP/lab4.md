# Laboratory 4 - OOP

## Using Data structures in Java and C++

##### Task1

-  Write a program which would find if a mathematical expression is correct from the point of view of the parentheses within it.

Ex: (2*9 + 4) - (3*(2+76) + 55) - correct
Ex: ((( 2-4 * 9 + 3 *  (4 + 5) - incorrect (3 unclosed parentheses)

Read the expression from the file attached at this laboratory(`one_expression.txt` ) and print the result if the parentheses are put correct in this expression.

*Bonus*: do the same for a file with 3 expressions in it and print in console information about all of them if the parenthesis in it are put correct.

`hint` - use stack to store parentheses.
