# Laboratory 2 - OOP

## Object instantiation via constructors.


##### Task1

-  Write a class Box and instatiate an object via its constructor.
The Box object should have three instance variables of floating number type(double): height, width, depth;

It should be possible to instantiate box object in 3 ways: 

1. without parameters (every attribute is instantiated to 1)
2. With 1 parameter (every attribute is instantiated with that parameter)
3. With 3 parameters for each attribute.

The box must have also 2 methods for calculation of its surface area and volume.


##### Task2

- Create a class Queue and instantiate 2 objects of this type. Each queue should have as state the number of elements from it and can be created via constructors of 2 types - with parameter and without it.

Implement add and get methods for adding elements to the queue and extraction of them.

Also implement two methods which should determine if the queue is empty or full. (isEmpty(), isFull()).
